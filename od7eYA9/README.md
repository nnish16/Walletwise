# WalletWise Product Pitch Website

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive and visually stunning single-page website that serves as a product pitch for the 'WalletWise' app. It was developed as a product thinking exercise specifically for a LinkedIn Associate Product Manager (APB) program application.

The website follows a clear narrative structure, taking the viewer through the problem space, the proposed solution, key features, and the future vision for the product, all based on the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD).

The design aesthetic is clean, modern, and professional, utilizing a dark theme, ample whitespace, and smooth animations to create a premium user experience, akin to top-tier tech product launch pages.

## Tech Stack

*   **HTML5**: For the core structure and content of the webpage.
*   **CSS3**: For custom styling and layout enhancements.
*   **TailwindCSS**: Used via CDN for rapid, utility-first styling.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ESM)**: For client-side interactivity and logic.
*   **Framer Motion**: A production-ready motion library for animations, used via CDN to create smooth, scroll-triggered effects.
*   **Lucide Icons**: For clean and consistent iconography.

## Features

The landing page is divided into several key sections to present a compelling product pitch:

1.  **Hero Section**: A powerful headline and tagline with the main app dashboard mockup.
2.  **The Problem**: Articulates the user pain points of managing credit card rewards.
3.  **The Solution**: Introduces WalletWise as the intelligent solution.
4.  **Key Features**: Showcases core functionalities with corresponding UI mockups.
5.  **Target Audience**: Describes the ideal user personas.
6.  **Product Vision & Roadmap**: Outlines the strategic future of WalletWise.
7.  **About the Project**: A concluding note explaining the context of the project for the LinkedIn APB application.

## How to Run

This project is built with vanilla web technologies and requires **no build step or compilation**.

1.  Ensure all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are in the same directory.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

The website will load all necessary assets from CDNs and run directly.

## File Structure

*   `index.html`: The main entry point containing the entire HTML structure of the single-page application.
*   `style.css`: Contains custom CSS rules to supplement TailwindCSS, including font imports, custom gradients, and specific element styling.
*   `script.js`: Handles all animations using Framer Motion and initializes the Lucide icon library. It is loaded as a module to enable modern JavaScript features.
*   `changelog.md`: The project blueprint outlining the purpose and relationships of each file.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
